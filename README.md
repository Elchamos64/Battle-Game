# Overview

Welcome to this simple battle game! This is a pretty easy to play game since it only does one thing... attack! You can do this by cliking on the enemy and it would deal damage to the enemy. If you health drops below 0 you lose.

The idea behind creating this game was to try to learn how to use Pygame python gameframe library and practice using functions and classes while making a fun game.

Below is a video link to the code review and game demo.

# Development Environment

As my code editor I used VS code. Python as my coding language and the followin libraries were used:
- Pygame
- Random
- Sys

Make sure to have Pygame installed before importing it.

# Useful Websites

To help me create this python game I watched a lot of video tutorials and the help of AI to help me debugg this code. The pygame website was also very helpful to help me learn the basics of pygame.
